# NBN algorithm in C# #

## Neural network learning with NBN algorithm in C# ##

NBN algorithm implemented in C# allowes you to:
  * learn neural networks with incredible convergance than any other algorithm,
  * easily proceed with learning and testing neural networks by nice and simple interface,
  * integrate this software in your application for free and with no effort,
  * keep your trainings in database to browse later,
  * export your results to other formats like PDF (all), text file (weighs), bitmap(charts),
  * filter results to find out what was the best solution.

You can test this software with embeded samples. Code is public so please feel free to use it and modify to improvements.
